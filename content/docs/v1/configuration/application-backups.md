LinkAce provides an easy way to back up the whole application including the database to the local filesystem, or any S3-compatible service, including Amazon AWS S3, Minio or Backblase B2. Under the hood LinkAce uses the [**Spatie Backup package**](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-backup/v6/introduction). Please consult the documentation of the package for advanced configuration.

{{< alert type="info" >}}
Starting with LinkAce 1.10.4 backups to the local filesystem are **enabled by default**.  
When using Docker, backups can be found in the `backups` folder outside the container.  
When using the PHP install method, backups can be found in the `storage/app/backups` folder.

{{< alert type="warning" >}}
You must [set up the cron]({{< relref path="docs/v1/configuration/system-settings.md#setting-up-the-cron" >}}) job for the backup system to work.
{{</ alert >}}

By default, the backup system will periodically purge old backups if they exceed 250 MB of disk usage. For more details, [read more about configuration](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-backup/v6/cleaning-up-old-backups/overview#content-determining-which-backups-should-be-deleted).


## Configure the backups

To back up LinkAce add the following settings to your .env file:

| .env setting | Possible values | Default value | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| `BACKUP_ENABLED` | `true`, `false` | `true` | Set to true to enable the application backups |
| `BACKUP_DISK` | `local_backups`, `s3` | `local_backups` | The storage for backups: `local_backups` saves the files to `/storage/app/backups`, `s3` saves to your configured S3 storage |
| `BACKUP_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL` | any email address | `your@email.com` | Set a valid email address to receive notification about backups. |
| `BACKUP_MAX_SIZE` | any number | `265` | The maximum size of all backups in MB. Once reached the oldest backups will be deleted. |

if you want to use AWS S3 for backups, define the key ID, the access key, the region and your bucket name here:

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=ZG25U...
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=V8pu...
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=eu-central-1
AWS_BUCKET=linkace
```

### Using a third-party S3-compatible service

Instead of Amazon AWS S3, you can use any S3-compatible service. To connect to the service instead of AWS, you have to set the correct endpoint in your `.env` file. Near your other AWS_ settings, add the following line and replace the URL with your own service URL:

```
AWS_ENDPOINT=https://minio.example.com
```
