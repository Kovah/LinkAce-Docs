BROADCAST_DRIVER=log
CACHE_DRIVER=file

## Using Redis sockets
# If you want to use Redis via a Unix socket, you can remove the hash before the following lines, but remove one before
# the "CACHE_DRIVER" line above. Also, set a proper path to your Redis socket.
#CACHE_DRIVER=redis-socket
#SESSION_CONNECTION=redis-socket
#REDIS_SCHEME=unix
#REDIS_PATH=/path/to/redis.sock
```
