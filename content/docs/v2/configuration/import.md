LinkAce provides a way to import existing bookmarks from your browser. Please notice, that you have to export your bookmarks in the HTML format. Other formats are not supported.

After choosing your import file, LinkAce will go through all bookmarks and save them as links. Please be patient! This process may take a long time, depending on the number of bookmarks to import. LinkAce tries to generate metadata for all new links, which requires accessing the website itself.

Once all bookmarks are imported, the application will show you a summary: how many bookmarks were imported, how many skipped.
